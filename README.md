# jAMALL

jAMALL allows you to swap JSON into YAML for the benefit of LLMs and back again.

Additionally, it will store the content of incoming and outgoing JSON/YAML blocks into python objects.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install jamall
```

Substitute json sections within a string with YAML code blocks.
